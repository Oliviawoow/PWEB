-----System architecture-----

Components:
	- MySQL database for storing informations localy
	- Frontend
	- Backend
	- Notification system to notify users of certain events
	
The client is represented by the application users, as well as by the application administrator.

In terms of functionality, we propose that the application can support a considerable number of users. Thus, for the backend part we will use MySQL database, and for the frontend part JavaScript and HTML / CSS / React.

Used APIs:
	- one for creating the connection with the database
	- one for the messages part -> sockets
	- one for the alert system
